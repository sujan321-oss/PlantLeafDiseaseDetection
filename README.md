# Plant Leaf Disease Detection 🌿🔍

Welcome to "Plant Leaf Disease Detection," my latest project aimed at revolutionizing plant health monitoring. This innovative tool employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for training, delivering exceptional precision in detecting three distinct types of plant leaf diseases affecting tomatoes, potatoes, and cotton plants. 🍅🥔🌿

# Key Features:

Multi-Plant Detection: This tool excels in detecting diseases in three essential plants: Tomato, Potato, and Cotton, ensuring comprehensive coverage for farmers and agricultural enthusiasts.

CNN Technology: Powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the system leverages advanced machine learning techniques for accurate disease identification and classification.

User-Friendly Web Interface: Accessible via a user-friendly web interface created with Django, HTML, and CSS, the tool provides a seamless experience for users to interact with the system.

# How to Use:

🌿 Select Plant Type: Choose the plant type (Tomato, Potato, or Cotton) you want to analyze.

📷 Upload Image: Upload an image of the plant leaves you suspect may be affected by disease.

🔍 Get Results: Let the system analyze the image and provide detailed insights into the presence of any diseases.

# Tech Stack:

🧠 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Employed for robust training and accurate disease classification.
🌐 Django, HTML, CSS: Crafted to perfection, the web interface ensures a user-friendly and engaging experience.
Our mission is to empower farmers, protect their crops, and enhance agricultural productivity through advanced technology. Feel free to explore, contribute, and join us in making a positive impact on agriculture with "Plant Leaf Disease Detection." Your feedback is highly valued! 🌱🌿
